<!-- Placeholder for Three.js library -->
<!-- This file should be replaced with the actual three.min.js from Three.js CDN -->
<!-- For GitHub Pages deployment, you can either:
1. Download three.min.js from https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js
2. Use the CDN directly by updating index.html to include:
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
-->

// This is a stub - will be replaced with actual Three.js library
window.THREE = window.THREE || {};
